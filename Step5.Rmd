# Step 5: Test data and future directions

## Public datasets

The pipeline with default settings (smoothing and color clusters of k-means in VNS function) used for the [Maynard, Collado-Torres et al, Nature Neuroscience, 2021](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-020-00787-0) LIBD data has been applied on the [public datasets](https://support.10xgenomics.com/spatial-gene-expression/datasets) provided by 10x Genomics. To demonstrate the utility of the pipeline on different datasets we chose images obtained from different tissues, in particular a [breast tissue](https://support.10xgenomics.com/spatial-gene-expression/datasets/1.1.0/V1_Breast_Cancer_Block_A_Section_1) sample with high density of cells and a [human heart tissue](https://support.10xgenomics.com/spatial-gene-expression/datasets/1.1.0/V1_Human_Heart) sample with low density of cells. Decent segmentation results were obtained with the default settings on the human heart tissue image given the low image resolution. With the number of color clusters changed from 5 (default) to 3 for breast tissue, the highly clustered cells were detected.

### Heart Tissue

Below is the full code for analyzing the heart tissue sample with low density of cells.

```Matlab
code = '/path to the code/VistoSeg/code';
addpath(genpath(code))
fname = '/path to the file/V1_Human_Heart_image.tif';
N = 5;

### Breast Tissue

Below is the full code for analyzing the breast tissue sample with a high density of cells. Note that `N` was changed from the default of 5 to 3.

```Matlab

## Future directions

Below is a non-comprehensive list of future directions. Please [get in touch with us](https://github.com/LieberInstitute/VistoSeg/issues) if you have suggestions.

1. Integrate Atlas Aligner for brain region identification.
2. Integrate [VAMPIRE](https://doi.org/10.1038/srep18437) for cell morphology detection.
