# SPOTSPOTCHECK

It is a matlab GUI for performing quality check on the nuclei segmentations from Step2. It also gives the nuclei count in each spot and provides an option to save/concatenate the count data to the tissue_positions_list.csv file. We will extract the metrics like spot diameter, distance between spots from the scalefactors_json.json and number of spots from tissue_positions_list.csv to reconstruct the spot grid for spotspotcheck. 

Describe what each column and row are in the tissue_positions_list.csv
