# Spatial_ImgProcessing
Image processing pipeline for spatial projects

This repository describes steps to run Image processing on visium/histology images for Spatial transcriptomics

[Step1](https://https://github.com/LieberInstitute/Spatial_ImgProcessing/blob/master/Steps/Step1.md): Split histology images into subsections\
[Step2](https://https://github.com/LieberInstitute/Spatial_ImgProcessing/blob/master/Steps/Step2.md): Segment nuclei from each histology subsection\
[Step3](https://https://github.com/LieberInstitute/Spatial_ImgProcessing/blob/master/Steps/Step3.md): Run spaceranger to get tissue_positions_list.csv\
[Step4](https://https://github.com/LieberInstitute/Spatial_ImgProcessing/blob/master/Steps/Step4.md): spotspotcheck for quality check on nuclei segmentations and counts\
[Step5](https://github.com/LieberInstitute/CaImg_cellcultures/blob/master/Steps/Step5.md): AtlasAligner\
